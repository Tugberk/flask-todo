# flask-todo
a simple todo list application with flask / python

i could not find a simple example where one can use sqlite3 and create a crud app
with flask without using any other stuff.

this program works by using sqlite. this is the simplest edition.
further editions may be under another name. 

todo:
- creating a db function and calling it
- using sessions and users
